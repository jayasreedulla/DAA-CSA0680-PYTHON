Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even. Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
a = [23, 14, 88, 56, 67, 83, 20, 29]
n = len(a)
print("even conditions:", end=" ")
for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(a[i], end=" ")
print("\nodd conditions:", end=" ")
for i in range(n):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(a[i], end=" ")
